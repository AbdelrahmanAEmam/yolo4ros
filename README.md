# yolo4ros
YOLO implementation for ROS -- Under Development

Download yolov3.weights [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n9MvXffqNCDBZv-9UEk26hlNVuhFQNpK/view?usp=sharing), add the weights file under /yolo-coco

### To-do:
~~1. Add BEV code and test on given images~~ <br>
~~2. Transform objects locations into distances and angles~~ <br>
3. Configure YOLO to work on ROS efficiently
